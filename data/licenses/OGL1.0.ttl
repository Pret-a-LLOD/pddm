For the purposes of this licence, ‘private monetary compensation’ does not include the exchange of the Information for other copyrighted works by means of digital file-sharing or otherwise provided there is no payment of any monetary compensation in connection with the exchange of the Information.\r\n\r\n‘Use’\r\nas a verb, means doing any act which is restricted by copyright or database right, whether in the original medium or in any other medium, and includes without limitation distributing, copying, adapting, modifying as may be technically necessary to use it in a different mode or format.\r\n\r\n‘You’\r\nmeans the natural or legal person, or body of persons corporate or incorporate, acquiring rights under this licence.\r\n\r\nAbout this Licence\r\n\r\nThe Controller of Her Majesty’s Stationery Office (HMSO) has developed this licence as a tool to enable Information Providers in the public sector to license the use and re-use of their Information under a common non-commercial licence. The Controller invites public sector bodies owning their own copyright and database rights to permit the use of their Information under this licence where licensing under the default Open Government Licence is not appropriate.\r\n\r\nThe Controller of HMSO has authority to license Information subject to copyright and database right owned by the Crown.\r\n\r\nThis is version 1.0 of the Non-Commercial Government Licence. The Controller of HMSO may, from time to time, issue new versions of the Non-Commercial Government Licence. However, you may continue to use Information licensed under this version should you wish to do so.\r\n\r\nFurther context, best practice and guidance can be found in the UK Government Licensing Framework section on The National Archives website.\r\n"@en ;
