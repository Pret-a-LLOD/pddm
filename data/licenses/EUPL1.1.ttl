For the sake of this clause,\r\n“Compatible Licence” refers to the licences listed in the appendix attached to this\r\nLicence. Should the Licensee’s obligations under the Compatible Licence conflict\r\nwith his/her obligations under this Licence, the obligations of the Compatible Licence\r\nshall prevail.\r\nProvision of Source Code: When distributing and/or communicating copies of the\r\nWork, the Licensee will provide a machine-readable copy of the Source Code or\r\nindicate a repository where this Source will be easily and freely available for as long\r\nas the Licensee continues to distribute and/or communicate the Work.\r\nLegal Protection: This Licence does not grant permission to use the trade names,\r\ntrademarks, service marks, or names of the Licensor, except as required for\r\nreasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing\r\nthe content of the copyright notice. \r\n6. Chain of Authorship\r\nThe original Licensor warrants that the copyright in the Original Work granted\r\nhereunder is owned by him/her or licensed to him/her and that he/she has the power\r\nand authority to grant the Licence.\r\nEach Contributor warrants that the copyright in the modifications he/she brings to the\r\nWork are owned by him/her or licensed to him/her and that he/she has the power and\r\nauthority to grant the Licence.\r\nEach time You accept the Licence, the original Licensor and subsequent Contributors\r\ngrant You a licence to their contributions to the Work, under the terms of this\r\nLicence.\r\n7. Disclaimer of Warranty\r\nThe Work is a work in progress, which is continuously improved by numerous\r\ncontributors. It is not a finished work and may therefore contain defects or “bugs”\r\ninherent to this type of software development.\r\nFor the above reason, the Work is provided under the Licence on an “as is” basis and\r\nwithout warranties of any kind concerning the Work, including without limitation\r\nmerchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, absence of defects or errors,\r\naccuracy, non-infringement of intellectual property rights other than copyright as\r\nstated in Article 6 of this Licence.\r\nThis disclaimer of warranty is an essential part of the Licence and a condition for the\r\ngrant of any rights to the Work.\r\n8. Disclaimer of Liability\r\nExcept in the cases of wilful misconduct or damages directly caused to natural\r\npersons, the Licensor will in no event be liable for any direct or indirect, material or\r\nmoral, damages of any kind, arising out of the Licence or of the use of the Work,\r\nincluding without limitation, damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer\r\nfailure or malfunction, loss of data or any commercial damage, even if the Licensor\r\nhas been advised of the possibility of such damage. However, the Licensor will be\r\nliable under statutory product liability laws as far such laws apply to the Work.\r\n9.

However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on your own\r\nbehalf and on your sole responsibility, not on behalf of the original Licensor or any\r\nother Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each\r\nContributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against such\r\nContributor by the fact You have accepted any such warranty or additional liability. \r\n10. Acceptance of the Licence\r\nThe provisions of this Licence can be accepted by clicking on an icon “I agree”\r\nplaced under the bottom of a window displaying the text of this Licence or by\r\naffirming consent in any other similar way, in accordance with the rules of applicable\r\nlaw. Clicking on that icon indicates your clear and irrevocable acceptance of this\r\nLicence and all of its terms and conditions.\r\nSimilarly, you irrevocably accept this Licence and all of its terms and conditions by\r\nexercising any rights granted to You by Article 2 of this Licence, such as the use of\r\nthe Work, the creation by You of a Derivative Work or the Distribution and/or\r\nCommunication by You of the Work or copies thereof.\r\n11.

Miscellaneous\r\nWithout prejudice of Article 9 above, the Licence represents the complete agreement\r\nbetween the Parties as to the Work licensed hereunder.\r\nIf any provision of the Licence is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, this\r\nwill not affect the validity or enforceability of the Licence as a whole. Such provision\r\nwill be construed and/or reformed so as necessary to make it valid and enforceable.\r\nThe European Commission may publish other linguistic versions and/or new versions\r\nof this Licence, so far this is required and reasonable, without reducing the scope of\r\nthe rights granted by the Licence. New versions of the Licence will be published with\r\na unique version number.\r\nAll linguistic versions of this Licence, approved by the European Commission, have\r\nidentical value. Parties can take advantage of the linguistic version of their choice. \r\n14.
